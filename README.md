# Logging View Plugin for OpenShift Console

This plugin adds the logging view into the 'observe' menu in the OpenShift console. It requires OpenShift 4.10.

This plugin connects to the [loki-operator](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/main/operator), so make sure is installed in your cluster.

## Development

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) are required
to build and run the plugin. To run OpenShift console in a container, either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io) and
[oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) are required.

### Running locally

In one terminal window, run:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run start`

In another terminal window, run:

1. `oc login` (requires [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) and an [OpenShift cluster](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create))
2. `scripts/environment.sh`
3. `scripts/start-console.sh` (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io))

This will run the OpenShift console in a container connected to the cluster
you've logged into. The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9001 with CORS enabled.
Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/monitoring/logs> to see the running plugin.

#### Running start-console with Apple silicon and podman

If you are using podman on a Mac with Apple silicon, `yarn run start-console`
might fail since it runs an amd64 image. You can workaround the problem with
[qemu-user-static](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) by running
these commands:

```bash
podman machine ssh
sudo -i
rpm-ostree install qemu-user-static
systemctl reboot
```

## Deployment on cluster

You can deploy the plugin to a cluster by instantiating the provided
[Plugin Resources](logging-view-plugin-resources.yaml). It will use the latest plugin
docker image and run a light-weight nginx HTTP server to serve the plugin's assets.

```sh
oc create -f logging-view-plugin-resources.yml
```

Once deployed, patch the [Console operator](https://github.com/openshift/console-operator)
config to enable the plugin.

```sh
oc patch consoles.operator.openshift.io cluster \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "plugins": ["logging-view-plugin"] } }' --type=merge
```
